# 📉 YouTube Dislike Bookmarklet  

### **Easily restore YouTube's dislike count without using an extension!**  

YouTube removed public dislikes, making it harder to gauge feedback. While many Chrome extensions exist to bring dislikes back, they often **track your activity** or **require background permissions**.  

This **bookmarklet** is a **zero-install, lightweight alternative** that simply **fetches the dislike count** and displays it next to the dislike button—just like before!  


## **🚀 Features**  

✅ **Restores real dislike counts** on YouTube videos  
✅ **No extensions needed**—just a bookmark you can click  
✅ **100% private**—no tracking, no data collection  
✅ **Works in all browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
✅ **Instant updates**—no need to install anything!
