📉 YouTube Dislike Bookmarklet
Easily restore YouTube's dislike count without using an extension!
YouTube removed public dislikes, making it harder to gauge feedback. While many Chrome extensions exist to bring dislikes back, they often track your activity or require background permissions.

This bookmarklet is a zero-install, lightweight alternative that simply fetches the dislike count and displays it next to the dislike button—just like before!

🚀 Features
✅ Restores real dislike counts on YouTube videos
✅ No extensions needed—just a bookmark you can click
✅ 100% private—no tracking, no data collection
✅ Works in all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
✅ Instant updates—no need to install anything!

📌 How to Use
1️⃣ Copy the code
2️⃣ Create a new bookmark in your browser.
3️⃣ Paste the copied code into the "URL" field of the bookmark.
4️⃣ Save the bookmark.
5️⃣ Go to any YouTube video and click the bookmarklet!

🎉 The dislike count will appear next to the dislike button automatically!

💡 Why Use This Instead of an Extension?
🔹 No Setup Required – Just save a bookmark and click when needed.
🔹 Runs Only When You Want – Unlike extensions, this only activates when clicked.
🔹 Works Everywhere – Even on restricted devices where extensions are blocked.
🔹 Fully Transparent – Just a short JavaScript snippet—no hidden tracking.

🎯 Use Cases
✔️ Spot Low-Quality Content – Quickly assess community feedback.
✔️ Avoid Misleading Reviews – Ensure tutorials and product reviews are helpful.
✔️ Journalists & Researchers – Get real audience sentiment without bias.
✔️ For Creators – See how your content is being received.

🛠 Troubleshooting
If the dislike count doesn't appear:
🔹 Make sure you're on a YouTube video page.
🔹 Refresh the page and click the bookmarklet again.
🔹 Ensure your browser supports JavaScript bookmarklets.
